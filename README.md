# Intelligent-Irrigation-System-using-Machine-Learning-and-IoT

1. Designed a farm irrigation circuit to control the water supply to the farm based on temperature and humidity.
2. Arduino, temperature and humidity sensors were used to collect data. Servo motors controlled the water supply and an LCD was used to display the optimal readings.
3. Various machine learning models were trained and based on accuracy Random Forest algorithm was chosen to determine the percentage of water flow in the farm.
